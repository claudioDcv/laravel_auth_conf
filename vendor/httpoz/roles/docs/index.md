Powerful package for handling roles in Laravel

#### History
This project was largely inspired by Roman's [romanbican/roles](https://github.com/romanbican/roles/) Laravel package. However at the time Laravel 5.3 was released his package was not actively maintained. I have ommitted permissions in this package in favour of Laravel's [Authorization](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/authorization). I intend to keep this package as simple and minimal as is possible.
