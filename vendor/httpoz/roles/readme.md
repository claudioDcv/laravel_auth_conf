Powerful package for handling roles in Laravel

## Documentation
You can find the [documentation here.](https://httpoz.github.io/roles/)

#### History
This project was largely inspired by Roman's [romanbican/roles](https://github.com/romanbican/roles/) Laravel package. However at the time Laravel 5.3 was released his package was not actively maintained. I have ommitted permissions in this package in favour of Laravel's [Authorization](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/authorization). I intend to keep this package as simple and minimal as is possible.

## More Information

For more information, please have a look at [HasRole](https://github.com/httpoz/roles/blob/master/src/HttpOz/Roles/Contracts/HasRole.php) contract.

## License

This package is free software distributed under the terms of the MIT license.
